### Safe Area Management

- Wrap app root with `SafeAreaProvider` (usually in `app/_layout.tsx`).
- Use `SafeAreaView` for top-level screens; avoid hardcoded insets.
- For scrollable content, use a `SafeAreaView` wrapper with `ScrollView` or `FlatList` that respects insets.
- Prefer hooks (`useSafeAreaInsets`) when custom spacing is required.

### Example

```tsx
import { SafeAreaProvider, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        {/* router slots */}
      </SafeAreaView>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```
