### Security

- Sanitize and validate user inputs; never trust network data blindly.
- Use `react-native-encrypted-storage` for sensitive data at rest.
- Communicate over HTTPS with proper auth; rotate tokens and handle refresh.
- Follow Expo security guide (`https://docs.expo.dev/guides/security/`).
- Restrict permissions; request at runtime with clear rationale.
