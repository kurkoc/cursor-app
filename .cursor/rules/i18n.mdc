### Internationalization (i18n)

- Use `expo-localization` and an i18n lib (e.g., `react-native-i18n` or i18next).
- Support multiple languages and RTL; test mirrored layouts.
- Ensure text scales with system settings; avoid truncation and hardcoded widths.
- Keep copy externalized; avoid inline strings in components.
