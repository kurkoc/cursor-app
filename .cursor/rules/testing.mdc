### Testing

- Unit tests: Jest + React Native Testing Library for components and hooks.
- Integration/e2e: Detox for critical flows.
- Use Expo testing tools for multiple environments.
- Snapshot tests for stable UI components sparingly.
- Mock native modules with stable interfaces; validate i18n fallbacks and dark mode.
