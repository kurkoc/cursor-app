### Performance Optimization

- Prefer Context + `useReducer` for shared state; keep component trees pure.
- Defer non-critical code with dynamic imports and `Suspense`.
- Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` to avoid wasted renders.
- Images: WebP where supported, define `contentFit`, width/height, and caching in `expo-image`.
- Startup: Use `SplashScreen` and avoid heavy work in initial render; hydrate data lazily.
- Animations and gestures: use `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler` APIs.
